# 🔧 User Data Structure Fix - COMPLETE

## 🎯 **Issue Identified and Fixed**

The user data was nested inside a `customer` object, but the code was trying to access it directly.

### **❌ Before (Broken):**
```javascript
user = {
  "customer": {
    "_id": "6854042a9d12e1e5dfc03656",
    "firstName": "Aneri",
    "lastName": "Lohakane",
    "email": "abhijeetghode.delxn@gmail.com",
    "phone": "+919322506730"
  }
}

// Code was trying to access:
user.firstName  // ❌ undefined
user.email      // ❌ undefined
```

### **✅ After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// Now correctly extracts user data:
const userData = user?.customer || user;

userData.firstName  // ✅ "Aneri"
userData.email      // ✅ "abhijeetghode.delxn@gmail.com"
```

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **1. User Data Extraction**
- Added `const userData = user?.customer || user;` throughout the code
- Handles both nested and direct user data structures
- Fallback to direct access if customer object doesn't exist

### **2. Debug Info Display**
- Updated to show actual user data from customer object
- Now displays real user ID, email, and name
- Shows correct authentication status

### **3. Razorpay Payment Processing**
- Fixed user data access in payment preparation
- Now uses real user email and name for Razorpay
- Proper customer ID for order tracking

### **4. UI Status Indicators**
- Updated authentication checks
- Fixed payment details display
- Correct disabled states for payment options

## 📊 **Expected Results Now**

### **✅ Debug Info Should Show:**
```
Debug Info:
Logged In: ✅ Yes
User ID: 6854042a9d12e1e5dfc03656
Email: abhijeetghode.delxn@gmail.com
Name: Aneri Lohakane
User Keys: customer
```

### **✅ Razorpay Section Should Show:**
- 🟢 **Green**: "✅ Ready for Razorpay payment"

- **Phone**: "+919322506730"
- **User ID**: "6854042a9d12e1e5dfc03656"
